### ü§î Why SkillSwap?

In a world of expensive online courses and passive learning, SkillSwap offers a dynamic, community-driven alternative.

  * **Breaks Financial Barriers:** Instead of money, the currency is your own knowledge. It creates an accessible ecosystem where learning is not limited by a user's financial status.
  * **Fosters Active Learning:** By teaching others, users reinforce their own understanding. This two-way exchange promotes deeper learning and mastery.
  * **Builds Community:** The platform is designed to connect people. From proposals to real-time chat, every interaction is a step towards building a supportive network of learners and mentors.
  * **Modern & Secure:** Built with industry-standard practices, SkillSwap provides a safe, reliable, and modern user experience that users can trust.

-----

### üåü Features In-Depth

#### üõ†Ô∏è Core Platform Mechanics

  * **Dual Skill Postings**: Users can create two types of listings: **Offers** (skills they are proficient in and willing to teach) and **Requests** (skills they wish to learn from the community).
  * **Credit-Based Economy**: New users are welcomed with 10 "Swap Credits". This initial capital allows them to immediately engage with the platform. They can earn more credits by successfully teaching their skills, creating a balanced and self-sustaining economic model.
  * **Flexible Proposal System**: Users can propose a skill swap in two ways:
    1.  **Credit Offer**: Propose a swap by offering the required number of credits set by the skill provider.
    2.  **Counter-Proposal**: Propose a direct exchange by offering one of their own skills in return, creating a barter-style trade.
  * **Advanced Search & Filtering**: A powerful and multi-faceted search system allows users to find skills with precision. Filters include keywords, category (e.g., 'Technology', 'Arts', 'Languages'), skill level (e.g., 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', 'Advanced'), and geographical location.
  * **Smart Search Suggestions**: The main keyword search bar implements the **Jaro-Winkler distance algorithm** (`p_jaro_winkler`) to provide "Did you mean...?" suggestions for common typos and misspellings, significantly improving the discoverability of skills.

#### üîê User Engagement & Security

  * **Secure JWT Authentication**: A robust authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). It employs a two-token strategy (access and refresh tokens) which are stored in secure, `httpOnly` cookies, preventing XSS attacks. The backend is completely stateless.
  * **OTP Email Verification**: New user registrations are protected by a One-Time Password (OTP) system. Accounts remain inactive and are not publicly visible until the user verifies their email address, effectively preventing spam and bot-driven account creation.
  * **Secure Account Recovery**: A complete "Forgot Password" and "Change Email" workflow, both secured via OTPs sent to the user's registered email, ensuring that only the legitimate owner can make critical account changes.
  * **Comprehensive User Profiles**: Rich, publicly viewable profiles that act as a user's portfolio, showcasing their offered skills, a detailed bio, links to social media or professional sites, and a collection of earned achievement badges.
  * **Customizable Avatars**: Users can personalize their identity by uploading a custom profile picture via a seamless Cloudinary integration. If no picture is uploaded, a stylish, deterministic initial-based avatar is generated using the DiceBear API.

#### ü§ñ Real-time Communication & AI

  * **Real-time User-to-User Chat**: A fully-featured, responsive, real-time chat system built with Socket.IO. It becomes available after a skill swap proposal is accepted, providing a dedicated channel for communication.
      * **Instant Message Delivery**: Leveraging WebSockets for low-latency, bidirectional communication.
      * **Multi-Message Selection**: Users can long-press (mobile) or right-click (desktop) to enter a selection mode, allowing for the deletion of multiple messages at once.
      * **Chat Management**: A three-dot menu within the chat provides options for clearing the entire chat history and reporting the other user.
  * **Live Notifications**: Users receive instant, real-time notifications for critical events such as new proposals on their skills, acceptance of their proposals, and account warnings, all without needing to refresh the page.
  * **Unread Message Counts**: The main navigation bar and the conversation list in the chat interface display a live, real-time count of unread messages, ensuring users never miss a conversation.
  * **AI Skill Assistant**: A floating chatbot powered by the **Google Gemini API** that acts as a helpful guide. It can answer user questions about different skills, suggest learning paths, and provide information available on the platform.
  * **AI Content Moderation**: To maintain a safe and focused learning environment, the AI automatically filters user searches for YouTube tutorials to block inappropriate, harmful, or off-topic queries.

#### üõ°Ô∏è Administration & Moderation

  * **Multilingual Profanity Filter**: The user-to-user chat automatically detects and censors abusive language in multiple languages (English, Hindi, Kannada) using a professional-grade filtering library (`bad-words`).
  * **Automated Reporting System**: A community-powered moderation system. Users can report others for inappropriate behavior. The system automatically issues a warning notification after 2 unique reports and permanently deletes the offending user's account and all associated content after 5 unique reports.
  * **Automated Database Cleanup**: A scheduled cron job runs daily (using `node-cron`) to automatically purge unverified user accounts that are older than 3 days, maintaining database hygiene and efficiency.
  * **Admin Role**: A built-in `admin` role in the User schema allows for future extensibility, such as a dedicated admin dashboard for managing users, reports, site content, and platform analytics.

-----

### üèóÔ∏è Architectural Overview

This project follows a professional, scalable MERN stack architecture, emphasizing a clean separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

  * **Stateless Backend API**: The Express.js server is designed to be completely stateless. User authentication is managed via JWTs sent in `httpOnly` cookies, meaning the server doesn't need to store session information. This makes the backend highly scalable and robust.
  * **Centralized API Logic**: All backend business logic is encapsulated within controllers, keeping the route definitions clean and readable. The `asyncHandler` utility ensures that all asynchronous errors are caught and passed to a centralized error handler, preventing server crashes.
  * **Component-Driven Frontend**: The React application is built using a modular, component-based architecture. Reusable components are organized by feature, making the codebase easy to navigate, maintain, and extend.
  * **Global State Management with Context API**: React's Context API is used for managing global state like user authentication, the WebSocket connection, and theme settings. This avoids prop-drilling and provides a clean way to share state across the application.
      * `AuthContext` holds the user's authentication status, profile data, and the global unread message count.
      * `SocketContext` establishes a single, persistent WebSocket connection upon user login, which is then available to any component that needs real-time functionality.

#### `client/` - React Frontend

The client is a modern Single-Page Application (SPA) bootstrapped with Vite for a fast development experience.

  * **`src/api/axios.js`**: A centralized Axios instance configured with a request interceptor to automatically attach the JWT access token to the headers of every outgoing API request.
  * **`src/context/`**: The core of the frontend's state management. `AuthContext` handles user data, `SocketContext` manages the single WebSocket connection, and `ThemeContext` handles light/dark mode.
  * **`src/hooks/useListenMessages.js`**: An example of a custom hook that encapsulates the logic for listening to real-time chat messages from the Socket.IO server, demonstrating a clean and reusable approach to handling real-time events.

#### `server/` - Node.js & Express Backend

The server is a robust REST API designed for security, efficiency, and scalability.

  * **`server.js`**: The main application entry point. It initializes the Express app, configures middleware (CORS, cookieParser, etc.), connects to MongoDB, attaches the Socket.IO server, and starts listening for HTTP requests.
  * **`socket/socket.js`**: This file exports a singleton instance of the Socket.IO server, ensuring that the same instance is used across the application for both chat and notifications. It also contains the logic for managing online users.
  * **`middlewares/auth.middleware.js`**: Contains the critical `verifyJWT` middleware. It extracts the JWT from the `httpOnly` cookie, verifies its signature, and attaches the decoded user payload to the `req` object, protecting secure routes.
  * **`utils/`**: A collection of powerful helper utilities.
      * `asyncHandler.js`: A higher-order function that wraps async controller functions in a `try...catch` block, forwarding any errors to the global error handler.
      * `ApiError.js` & `ApiResponse.js`: Standardized classes for creating consistent error and success JSON responses across the entire API.
      * `cronJobs.js`: Defines the cron job for daily cleanup of unverified users.
